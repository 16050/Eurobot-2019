To use the Arduinos with rosserial-python, you can use the launchfiles.

For the first Arduino (/dev/ttyACM0):
roslaunch intelligence arduino0.launch

For the second Arduino (/dev/ttyACM1):
roslaunch intelligence arduino1.launch

For the third Arduino (/dev/ttyACM0):
roslaunch intelligence arduino2.launch

To connect all the Arduinos (/dev/ttyACM0-2), you can use the following command:
roslaunch intelligence all.launch
